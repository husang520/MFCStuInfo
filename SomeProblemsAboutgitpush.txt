If there have above information in gitbash, it means that you have git push successfully.



Some git command:
For local repository, you should use git init.
Then use git add . Attention: there is a blank between add and .
Then use git commit -m "first commit"
For github repository, you should create a new repository. For local repository using.
Then use git remote add origin your repository address example for use: 
git remote add origin https://github.com/husang520/MFCStuInfo.git

Last, use git push -u origin master

There is another problem when you use git push origin master.

fatal: unable to access 'https://github.com/husang520/MFCStuInfo.git/': OpenSSL SSL_read: 
SSL_ERROR_SYSCALL, errno 0

Then you should input this two command:
//取消http代理
git config --global --unset http.proxy
//取消https代理 
git config --global --unset https.proxy




Then you finish the all step.

Using 方法二.

When I git push a new revised file of local repository, after I use git add and git commit -m "log", use git push origin master(it is no need for user to add -u like git push -u origin master for second push). There have some error:
 git push -u origin master
To https://github.com/husang520/unicomp.git
 ! [rejected]        master -> master (fetch first)
error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/husang520/unicomp.git'
hint: Updates were rejected because the remote contains work that you do
hint: not have locally. This is usually caused by another repository pushing
hint: to the same ref. You may want to first integrate the remote changes
hint: (e.g., 'git pull ...') before pushing again.
hint: See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details.

First input git pull --rebase origin master (pull = fetch + merge) , then input git push origin master. The error can be solved.
