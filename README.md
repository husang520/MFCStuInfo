This is a program about MFC student information system.
It offers an UI for user to communicate with PC, we can click the .exe file to use the system.


And I have learned how to use git to upload my code to github repository.

The git admit only 50MiB file, the file which will upload can't pass 50MiB. I don't know how to do with this.

And this program use MySQL data, so user should download MySQL data. Otherwise, this program can't run.
